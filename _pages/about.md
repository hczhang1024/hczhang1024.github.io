<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a third year Ph.D. Candidate in [Department of Statistics](https://science.psu.edu/stat), [The Pennsylvania State University](https://science.psu.edu/stat).  My research lies at the intersection of **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and **Federated Learning (FL)**, with a dual focus on:  
1. **Theoretical Foundations**:  Designing provably efficient RL/FRL algorithms to achieve optimal learning accuracy while improving computational and communication efficiency. 

2. **Practical Applications**:  Designing adaptable models that bridge algorithmic innovation with real-world biomedical and healthcare challenges.

You can find my [CV](../assets/CV_Haochen_Zhang.pdf) here.

I am very furtunate to be advised by [Prof. Lingzhou Xue](https://lingzhou-xue.github.io/index.html) from Department of Statistics, The Pennsylvania State University.
